# Overview
Plenty of books, courses, and podcasts about professional development and leadership exist. I am sharing a few ideas and thoughts arising through conversation or readings. I have 0 answers, just beliefs.

Here's a sampling of experts:
* [HBR series](https://www.amazon.com/HBR-20-Minute-Manager-Boxed-Books/dp/1633690954)
* People Analytics: [work rules!](https://www.workrules.net/)
* Personality assessments: [corestrengths](https://www.corestrengths.com/)
* [Memoirs](https://davidgoggins.com/book/) and [pop-psychology](https://www.danpink.com/)

## Lessons from David Goggins
I completed [Never Finished](https://www.amazon.com/Never-Finished-Unshackle-Your-Within/dp/1544534086) and [Can't Hurt Me](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512287) over a few days in a spellbound frenzy. Here's my key takeaway as one of the - prosaic many :hugs::

* **Challenges versus Goals**: Goals are great,  aspirational ones provide a north star. But, creating a series of challenges leads to our internal greatness. As a manager, we can help our team grow by giving clearly defined challenges.

* **Learn from failures and know when to fold**: I didn't realize David Goggins failed a lot, which is expected because he gave himself crazy challenges. Innovation is an arena that generates A LOT of failures. As a manager, we need to decide - what did we learn? Can we create an alternative path? If not - let's fold and move on, taking what we learn to the next challenge.

* **Heart is great, Heart + Brain is better**: The evolution in his book is pretty cool to see unfold. At first, he just leverages pure willpower, then evolves into more strategic approaches with each challenge. Great managers think deeply about why and where to invest time and effort. In a way, how can we do what we do more efficiently and with purpose towards a vision to create business value?

 In the end, he is challenging us to find our maximum capabilities - a message that resonates with me.  

## Vision
I feel that a manager's top responsibility is to develop a vision and evangelize.

This [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins) articulated in a compelling manner that 'making progress in meaningful work' boost motivation (aka 'a good day'). In order to have progress, we need a vision. No vision - we're just adrift, slowly getting demotivated.

## Collaboration
**IF** done right, and it's magical when it's a great session, collaboration leads to better solutions in a shorter time. Yet, I still see managers treat workers like cogs in an assembly line.
