# Overview
Plenty of books, courses, and podcasts about professional development and leadership exist. I am sharing a few ideas and thoughts arising through conversation or readings. I have 0 answers, just beliefs.

Here's a sampling of experts:
* [HBR series](https://www.amazon.com/HBR-20-Minute-Manager-Boxed-Books/dp/1633690954)
* People Analytics: [work rules!](https://www.workrules.net/)
* Personality assessments: [corestrengths](https://www.corestrengths.com/)
* [Memoirs](https://davidgoggins.com/book/) and [pop-psychology](https://www.danpink.com/)


## Vision
I personally feel that a manager's top responsibility is to develop a vision and evangelize.

This [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2011/05/the-power-of-small-wins) articulated in a compelling manner that 'making progress in meaningful work' boost motivation (aka 'a good day'). In order to have progress, we need a vision. No vision - we're just adrift, slowly getting demotivated.

## Collaboration
**IF** done right, and it's magical when it's a great session, collaboration leads to better solutions in a shorter time. Yet, I still see managers treat workers like cogs in an assembly line.
