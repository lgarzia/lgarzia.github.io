Despite advances such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), fine tuning LLMs is still extremely challenging. Make sure you exhaust the potential of in-context learning, following OpenAI’s guide and techniques such as promptbase. Fine tune as a last resort and expect many attempts before succeeding.

The escalating series of models, including Mamba, Mamba MOE, MambaByte, and the latest approaches like Cascade, Layer-Selective Rank Reduction (LASER), and Additive Quantization for Language Models (AQLM) have revealed new levels of cognitive power.
