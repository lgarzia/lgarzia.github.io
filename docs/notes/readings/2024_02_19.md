[prometheus](https://huggingface.co/papers/2310.08491?ref=blog.premai.io): evaluating LLMs

[llmware](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware)
As enterprises look to deploy LLMs in more complex production use cases beyond simple knowledge assistants, there is a growing recognition of three interconnected needs:

Agents – complex workflows involve multiple steps and require the orchestration of multiple LLM calls;

Function Calls – models need to be able to generate structured output that can be handled programmatically, including key tasks such as classification and clustering, which often times are the connective tissue in such workflows; and

Private Cloud – models and data pipelines need to be finetuned and tightly integrated with sensitive existing enterprise processes and data stores.
