## Rust

[serde](https://www.shuttle.rs/blog/2024/01/23/using-serde-rust): defacto standard library for serialization and deserialization
[tagged types](https://experimentalworks.net/posts/2024-01-22-simple-phantom-types/): an elegant solution to ensure the appropriate value of the same types fed into a function (eg. group id versus user id)

## AI Engineering

[AI Function Calling](https://gradientflow.com/expanding-ai-horizons-the-rise-of-function-calling-in-llms/) LLMs that call functions instead of just returning functions.
[Vertex AI Function Calling](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/multimodal/function-calling)
[Leader Board](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard?utm_source=marktechpost-newsletter.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=sponsored-content-from-height-google-s-bard-has-just-made-a-stunning-leap-surpassing-gpt-4-to-the-second-spot-on-the-leaderboard): Interesting difference between Bard (Gemini Pro) and Gemini Pro (Dev API)

- [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT)
- [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi): BabyCoder is one of the BabyAGI variants which specializes in writing code. Unlike AutoGPT, which creates agents on the fly, BabyCoder uses a handful of predefined, specific agents who work together to come up with a functional project.

A single model won’t “rule them all.” According to Menlo’s Enterprise AI report, 60% of enterprises use multiple models and route prompts to the most performant model. This multi-model approach eliminates single-model dependency, offers higher controllability, and cuts costs.

- Therefore, observability and evaluation present a significant opportunity for new tooling. Already, we are seeing promising new approaches like Braintrust, Patronus, Log10, and AgentOps.
- [deloitte state of gen ai](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consulting/us-state-of-gen-ai-report.pdf): Relative to other respondents, leaders who rated their organization’s overall generative AI expertise as “very
  high” tended to feel much more positive about the technology; however, they also feel more pressure to
  adopt it—and see it as more of a threat to their business and operating models
