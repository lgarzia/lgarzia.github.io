# Overview
My objective is to keep a pulse on the evolving ecosystem. I mostly cover libraries and features.

## [Python Libraries](./python-libraries) <Badge type="warning" text="not tutorials" />
I have a backlog of libraries that I come across that sound interesting. I'll timebox a couple of hours
to explore them. All activity is captured in the following [repo](https://github.com/lgarzia/library_explorations).
