# Overview
I sit at the intersection of **Analytics and Engineering**, where my primary toolkit is Google Cloud Platform, Python, and PySpark. I *attempt* to monitor industry trends and *stay relevant* by investing time in learning new tools and ideas. Finally, **soft skills** are crucial to project success, so I occasionally recollect on experiences and conversations and share what I believe to be true. 

# Where I'm currently investing my time

::: details Rust-100 day challenge
My thoughts align with [SeatleDataGuy](https://seattledataguy.substack.com/p/behind-the-rust-hype-what-every-data).
Python ecosystem is going through a [*rustification* process](https://python.plainenglish.io/the-development-trend-of-python-in-2023-deep-integration-with-rust-easier-to-write-web-fc92716ae653). While, it's unlikely analyst and engineers will leverage Rust directly, like most don't leverage C directly. In my opinion, I think it's beneficial to demystify and develop a working knowledge of Rust, hence working through a 100-day challenge.

::: details AI Engineering (Rise of LLM Apps)
The rise of [AI Agents](https://e2b.dev/blog/ai-agents-vs-developers?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email) is inevitable. The idea of creating an adaptable application that can learn and remain flexible without code change is remarkable. Furthermore, the *fragile* prompt engineering process will give way to abstractions like ['reasoning'](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy), demonstrating a paradigm shift in application and data analytics **will happen**.

::: details GCP - Vertex AI
The motivation should be self-evident - Cloud Native Applications are the present and [future](https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS51179523). Furthermore, LLM foundational models are highly concentrated on a *few* players[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/156WpBF_rGvf4Ecg19oM1fyR51g4FAmHV3Zs0WLukrLQ/edit#slide=id.g24daeb7f4f0_0_3507]. Through fate of circumstance, I'm invested in Google Cloud Platform.

# Topics & Technologies
Navigate to relevant sections of interest.
::: tip no tutorials
I avoid step-by-step tutorials and focus mainly on broad ideas, mental models, & use cases because, generally speaking, the germane references are really good these days.
:::

## Analytics & Data Mining
Researching tools, techniques, and concepts to extract meaning from data.

## Articles
Sharing links to articles I found interesting and insightful.

## DE, ML & Analytical Engineering
Tracking industry changes & exploring concepts & ideas. I believe all these responsibilities overlap significantly and *could* be considered a singular job function.

## [Google Cloud Platform](/notes/gcp/)
Leveraging GCP services and architectural patterns - heavy emphasis at times is on BigQuery.

## LLM|AI Engineering
Building applications with LLMs and AI Agents.

## [Python](/notes/python/)
Keeping a pulse on the Python ecosystem by mostly exploring new libraries. 

## Rust
Learning Rust and system programming.
 
## Soft Skills
Musing about non-technical aspects of projects.

## Web
Developing front-end experiences.
