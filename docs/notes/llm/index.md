# Overview
The evolution of LLM is nothing short of extraordinary. Hype cycle or not, AI agents will have a profound way we work & interact with the world.

GCP [Duet AI](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/write-sql-duet-ai) demos were a revelation. I started exploring the open-source LLM and wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@garzia.luke/developing-intuition-around-llm-code-assistants-via-open-source-models-afb0a1152240)building up an intuition around code generation. I am keeping a [repo](https://github.com/lgarzia/llm_apps_experimenting) where I explore various libraries and concepts.

I separate AI engineering from others because it's highly exploratory. The big ideas are emerging - leveraging AI Agents to manage tasks and **control flows**. My ideal AI Agent - here's my dashboard; tell me what I need to know for the day - I don't have to provide statistical boundaries.

What follows here is just *attempts* to keep pace!

## Industry Landscape & Current State
* [State of open-source AI book](https://book.premai.io/state-of-open-source-ai/)
* [e2b landscape-latest](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/e2b-dev/awesome-ai-agents/main/assets/landscape-latest.png)
* [PALM2 Release](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WF4xjKgU8r0)

## Thought Provoking Articles, Libraries
* [e2b ai agents versus developers](https://e2b.dev/blog/the-state-of-ai-agents-reliability-sdks-benchmarking-and-market-trends?ref=ai-agents-vs-developers)
* [Standford DSPy](https://github.com/stanfordnlp/dspy): DSPy unifies techniques for prompting and fine-tuning LMs — and approaches for reasoning, self-improvement, and augmentation with retrieval and tools. Abstractions around thought processes to avoid brittle and hard code prompts. 


## Libraries Explored
* [haystack](https://github.com/deepset-ai/haystack) - is an end-to-end NLP framework that enables you to build applications powered by LLMs, Transformer models, vector search and more.
* [langchain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain) - library aims to assist in the development of LLM based applications.
* [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/) - is a data framework for LLM-based applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data.
* [semantic-kernel](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/overview/) - framework powering Copilot.

## Company Inventory
I am primarily focused on business intelligence and automated data analysis.
* [Julius](https://julius.ai/) - AI data analyst & more
* [getdot.ai](https://www.getdot.ai/) - Make Data-Driven Decisions, Fast
* [Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/endpoints) <-- managed llm endpoints
