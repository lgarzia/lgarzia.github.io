- [LLaMA-Factory](https://github.com/hiyouga/LLaMA-Factory): Fine-tuning Open Source Models
- **DPO**: DPO stands for Direct Preference Optimization. It's an alternative approach to traditional reinforcement learning (RL) methods for adapting LLMs to specific tasks or preferences.
- [MISTRAL AI](https://mistral.ai/): Committing to open models
- [Mixtral 8x7B](https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/): A 7B sparse Mixture-of-Experts model with stronger capabilities than Mistral 7B. Uses 12B active parameters out of 45B total. Supports multiple languages, code and 32k context window
- [mergekit](https://github.com/cg123/mergekit): toolkit for merging pre-trained language models.
- [tutorial](https://freedium.cfd/https://towardsdatascience.com/merge-large-language-models-with-mergekit-2118fb392b54)
- [datagpt](https://datagpt.com/): I believe this is the future of Data Analysis. AI agents scanning behind the scene surfacing insights to be interpreted
- LiteLLM

- [LLM's outlines](https://github.com/outlines-dev/outlines)
- [LLM's prompt tools](https://github.com/hegelai/prompttools)
- [AI Function Calling](https://gradientflow.com/expanding-ai-horizons-the-rise-of-function-calling-in-llms/) LLMs that call functions instead of just returning functions.
- [current state of coding agent](https://deepsense.ai/coding-agents-in-large-language-models?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email).
- [AutoGPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/AutoGPT)
- [BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi): BabyCoder is one of the BabyAGI variants which specializes in writing code. Unlike AutoGPT, which creates agents on the fly, BabyCoder uses a handful of predefined, specific agents who work together to come up with a functional project.

[menlo modern ai stack](https://menlovc.com/perspective/the-modern-ai-stack-design-principles-for-the-future-of-enterprise-ai-architectures/)
A single model won’t “rule them all.” According to Menlo’s Enterprise AI report, 60% of enterprises use multiple models and route prompts to the most performant model. This multi-model approach eliminates single-model dependency, offers higher controllability, and cuts costs.

Therefore, observability and evaluation present a significant opportunity for new tooling. Already, we are seeing promising new approaches like Braintrust, Patronus, Log10, and AgentOps.

- [deloitte state of gen ai](https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/us/Documents/consulting/us-state-of-gen-ai-report.pdf): Relative to other respondents, leaders who rated their organization’s overall generative AI expertise as “very
  high” tended to feel much more positive about the technology; however, they also feel more pressure to
  adopt it—and see it as more of a threat to their business and operating models
