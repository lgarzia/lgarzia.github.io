# About Me

I sit at the intersection of **Analytics and Engineering** developing insights, pipelines and tools to support both.

My primary toolkit is:

- Google Cloud Platform
- Python
- PySpark

Secondary tools are Javascript & Vue Framework while trying to grow my personal Rust adoption.

My vehicle for continuous learning is my Python library called chart-me and burning through GCP credits developing end-to-end implementations.

I _attempt_ to monitor data industry trends and _stay relevant_ by investing time in learning new tools and ideas.

I'm currently working with [orgacuity](https://www.orgacuity.com/) on implementing modern LLMs effectively.
